# mecanum-wheeled-robot-benchmarks
This repository is a dedicated space for sharing the code resources associated with two mobile robot benchmarks, designed for the rigorous analysis and testing of control systems in robotics. Here, you'll find everything you need to run the Mecanum-wheeled robot prototype and to simulate its digital twin within a MATLAB environment.
